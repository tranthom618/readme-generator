  ## Description
  
  The readme-generator is a useful tool to help automate aspects of readme creation on future projects. Building this project also doubled as a valuable learning experience in exploring node js, as well as the node packages of File System (fs) and Inquirer. This project also provided a more expansive understanding on the usage of template literals and interpolation.

  ## Installation

  Download the contents of this repository, then save or unzip them into a single folder. Using Visual Studio Code, you can open that folder. Right-click on index.js and select "Open in Integrated Terminal". For the initial startup, type into the command line terminal "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" which will take a few seconds to install the Inquirer node package. Once that is complete, type into the command line terminal "node index.js". This will initialize the questionnaire process, which will detail each section of your readme.


  ## Usage

  If Inquirer is installed, the user can type "node index.js" into the command line terminal to start the application. Once the application is started, a series of questions will be asked of the user to fill in the sections of their readme.

  ## Contributing

  A readme is fairly simple and straightforward, so there won't be a large number of useful features to add. Perhaps a more expansive selection of different license types would be one example, though the current 5 available to select comprise about 85% of all GitHub projects. A more robust contribution would be a dedicated User Interface to provide easier execution instead of through the command line terminal.

  ## Tests

  The steps outlined in "Installation" and "Usage" can be repeated as many times as a user desires. The first time through, a README.md file will be created. Each sequential execution of this application will replace the previous README.md file, which will allow a user to test as needed before they have their final draft. In order to save a README.md file without allowing it to be overwritten, simply move the README.md file to another file directory or rename to an alternative file name.
